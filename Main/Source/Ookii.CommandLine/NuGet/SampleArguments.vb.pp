Class SampleArguments

    ' This property defines a required positional argument called "Source". It can be set by name as e.g. "-Source value", or by position
    ' by specifying "value" as the first positional argument. Note that by default command line argument names are case insensitive, so
    ' this argument can also be specified as e.g. "-source value".
    ' On Windows, the default command name prefixes are "/" and "-", so the argument can also be specified as e.g. "/Source value". On Unix
    ' (using Mono), only "-" is accepted by default.
    <CommandLineArgument(Position:=0, IsRequired:=True), Description("The source data.")>
    Public Property Source As String

    ' This property defines a required positional argument called "Destination". It can be set by name as e.g. "-Destination value", or by position
    ' by specifying "value" as the second positional argument.
    <CommandLineArgument(Position:=1, IsRequired:=True), Description("The destination data.")>
    Public Property Destination As String

    ' This property defines a optional positional argument called "Index". It can be set by name as e.g. "-Index 5", or by position
    ' by specifying e.g. "5" as the third positional argument. If the argument is not specified, this property
    ' will be set to the default value 1.
    <CommandLineArgument(Position:=2, DefaultValue:=1), Description("The operation's index.")>
    Public Property Index As Integer

    ' This property defines an argument named "Date". This argument is not positional, so it can be supplied only by name, for example as "-Date 2013-01-31".
    ' This argument uses a nullable value type so it will be set to Nothing if the value is not supplied, rather than having to choose a default value.
    ' For types other than string, CommandLineParser will use the TypeConverter for the argument's type to try to convert the string to
    ' the correct type. You can use your own custom classes or structures for command line arguments as long as you create a TypeConverter for
    ' the type.
    ' The type conversion from string to DateTime is culture sensitive. Which culture is used is indicated by the CommandLineParser.Culture
    ' property, which defaults to the user's current culture. Always pay attention when a conversion is culture specific (this goes for
    ' dates, numbers, and various other types) and consider whether the current culture is the right choice for your application. In some cases
    ' using CultureInfo.InvariantCulture could be more appropriate.
    <CommandLineArgument(), Description("Provides a date to the application; the format to use depends on your locale.")>
    Public Property [Date] As Date?

    ' This property defines an argument named "Count".
    ' This argument uses a custom ValueDescription so it shows up as "-Count <Number>" in the usage rather than as "-Count <Int32>"
    <CommandLineArgument(ValueDescription:="Number"), Description("Provides the count for something to the application.")>
    Public Property Count As Integer

    ' This property defines a switch argument named "Verbose".
    ' Non-positional arguments whose type is "Boolean" act as a switch; if they are supplied on the command line, their value will be true, otherwise
    ' it will be false. You don't need to specify a value, just specify "-Verbose" to set it to true. You can explicitly set the value by
    ' using "-Verbose:true" or "-Verbose:false" if you want, but it is not needed.
    ' If you give an argument the type bool?, it will be true if present, Nothing if omitted, and false only when explicitly set to false using "-Verbose:false"
    ' This argument has an alias, so it can also be specified using "-v" instead of its regular name. An argument can have multiple aliases by specifying
    ' the Alias attribute more than once.
    <CommandLineArgument, [Alias]("v"), Description("Print verbose information; this is an example of a switch argument.")>
    Public Property Verbose As Boolean

    ' This property defines a multi-value argument named "Value". Its name is specified explicitly so it differs from the property name.
    ' A multi-value argument can be specified multiple times. Every time it is specified, the value will be added to the array.
    ' To set multiple values, simply repeat the argument, e.g. "-Value foo -Value bar -Value baz" will set it to an array containing { "foo", "bar", "baz" }
    ' Since no default value is specified, the property will be Nothing if -Value is not supplied at all.
    ' Multi-value arguments can be created either using a property of an array type, or using a read-only property of any collection type (e.g. List<T>).
    ' The element type doesn't have to be a string. Any type that can be used for normal arguments can also be used for multi-value arguments.
    <CommandLineArgument("Value"), Description("This is an example of a multi-value argument, which can be repeated multiple times to set more than one value.")>
    Public Property Values As String()

    ' This property defines a switch argument named "Help", with the alias "?".
    ' For this argument, we handle the CommandLineParser.ArgumentParsed event to cancel
    ' command line processing when this argument is supplied. That way, we can print usage regardless of what other arguments are
    ' present. For more details, see the CommandLineParser.ArgumentParser event handler in Program.cs
    <CommandLineArgument, [Alias]("?"), Description("Displays this help message.")>
    Public Property Help As Boolean

    Public Shared Function Create(ByVal args() As String) As SampleArguments
        ' Using a Shared creation function for a command line arguments class is not required, but it's a convenient
        ' way to place all command-line related functionality in one place. To parse the arguments (eg. from the Main method)
        ' you then only need to call this function.
        Dim parser As New CommandLineParser(GetType(SampleArguments))

        ' WriteUsageToConsole automatically uses a LineWrappingTextWriter to properly word-wrap the text.

    Private Shared Sub CommandLineParser_ArgumentParsed(sender As Object, e As ArgumentParsedEventArgs)
        ' When the -Help argument (or -? using its alias) is specified, parsing is immediately cancelled. That way, CommandLineParser.Parse will
        ' return null, and the Create method will display usage even if the correct number of positional arguments was supplied.

        ' arguments are supplied.
