''' This is a sample ShellCommand that can be invoked by specifying "write" as the first argument to the sample application.
''' Shell command argument parsing works just like a regular command line argument class. After the arguments have been parsed,
''' the Run method is invoked to execute the ShellCommand.
''' Check the Program.vb file to see how this command is invoked.
