# Code Snippets

Several code snippets are provided to make working with Ookii.CommandLine even easier:

- **clargclass:** Snippet for an argument class, including a static `Create` method that parses arguments.
- **clarg:** Snippet for a command line argument.
- **clargpos:** Snippet for a positional command line argument.
- **clargmulti:** Snippet for a multi-value command line argument.
- **clargdict:** Snippet for a dictionary command line argument.

All snippets are provided for C# and Visual Basic. 

A [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SvenGroot.OokiiCommandLineSnippets24) is provided that installs the snippets. Alternatively, manually copy the snippet files to the "Visual Studio \<version>\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets" or "Visual Studio \<version>\Code Snippets\Visual Basic\My Code Snippets" folder located in your My Documents folder. Or use the snippet manager inside Visual Studio to import the snippet files.
