# Introduction

Ookii.CommandLine is a library that helps you to parse command line arguments for your applications.
In this guide, we will introduce the basic functionality using a tutorial, describe in detail the
command line parsing rules used and how to create various types of arguments, how to use and
customize usage help, and explain other functionality such as subcommands.

In addition to this documentation, several [samples](../src/Samples) are provided, all with
explanations of what they do and examples of their output.
