# Generating usage help

When you have an application that accepts command line arguments, you'll want to be able to show a
help message to the user, indicating all the possible command line arguments.

Creating this kind of usage help text is tedious, and you must make sure it is kept up to date
whenever you change the arguments to your application. Ookii.CommandLine generates this usage help
text automatically, alleviating this problem.

Usage help can be generated using the [`CommandLineParser.WriteUsage()`][] method. The output can be
customized using the [`UsageWriter`][] class. By default, the [`CommandLineParser.WriteUsage()`][] method will
write the usage help to the standard output stream, using the [`LineWrappingTextWriter`][] class to
white-space wrap the text at the console width.

If you use the static [`CommandLineParser.Parse<T>()`][] method, usage help will be printed
automatically in the event the command line is invalid, or the "-Help" argument was used. In this
case, you can customize the output using the [`ParseOptions.UsageWriter`][] property.

The following example shows the usage help generated for the [parser sample](../src/Samples/Parser)
application included with the Ookii.CommandLine library:

```text
Sample command line application. The application parses the command line and prints the results,
but otherwise does nothing and none of the arguments are actually used for anything.

Usage: Parser [-Source] <String> [-Destination] <String> [[-OperationIndex] <Int32>] [-Count
   <Number>] [-Date <DateTime>] [-Day <DayOfWeek>] [-Help] [-Value <String>...] [-Verbose]
   [-Version]

    -Source <String>
        The source data.

    -Destination <String>
        The destination data.

    -OperationIndex <Int32>
        The operation's index. Default value: 1.

    -Count <Number>
        Provides the count for something to the application. Must be between 0 and 100.

    -Date <DateTime>
        Provides a date to the application.

    -Day <DayOfWeek>
        This is an argument using an enumeration type. Possible values: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
        Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

    -Help [<Boolean>] (-?, -h)
        Displays this help message.

    -Value <String>
        This is an example of a multi-value argument, which can be repeated multiple times to set
        more than one value.

    -Verbose [<Boolean>] (-v)
        Print verbose information; this is an example of a switch argument.

    -Version [<Boolean>]
        Displays version information.
```

The usage help consists of three components: the application description, the argument syntax, and
the argument descriptions.

## Application description

The first part of the usage help is a description of your application. This is a short description
that explains what your application does and how it can be used. It can be any text you like, though
itâ€™s recommended to keep it short.

The description is specified by using the [`System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute`][] on the class
that defines the command line arguments, as in the following example:

```csharp
[Description("This is the application description that is included in the usage help.")]
class MyArguments
{
}
```

If this attribute is not specified, no description is included in the usage help. The description
can also be omitted by setting the [`UsageWriter.IncludeApplicationDescription`][] property to
false.

If you are using [subcommands](Subcommands.md), this first line is the command description, which
is specified the same way, by applying the [`DescriptionAttribute`][] to your command class.

## Argument syntax

The argument syntax shows the arguments and their types, telling the user in short how your
application can be invoked from the command line. The argument syntax typically starts with the name
of the application executable, and is followed by all the arguments, indicating their name and type.
There is an indication of which arguments are required or optional, and whether they allow multiple
values.

The order of the arguments in the usage syntax is as follows:

1. The positional arguments, in their defined order.
2. Required positional arguments, in alphabetical order.
3. The remaining arguments, in alphabetical order.

The syntax for a single argument has the following format:

1. For a required, non-positional argument:

    ```text
    -ArgumentName <ValueDescription>
    ```

2. For an optional, non-positional argument:

    ```text
    [-ArgumentName <ValueDescription>]
    ```

3. For a required, positional argument:

    ```text
    [-ArgumentName] <ValueDescription>
    ```

4. For an optional, positional argument:

    ```text
    [[-ArgumentName] <ValueDescription>]
    ```

5. For a switch argument:

    ```text
    [-ArgumentName]
    ```

6. For a multi-value or dictionary argument (which can be combined with the other formatting
   options):

    ```text
    -ArgumentName <ValueDescription>...
    ```

Essentially, anything that's optional is enclosed in square brackets, switch arguments have their
value description (the argument type) omitted, and multi-value arguments are followed by an ellipsis.
This is the default formatting; it can be [customized](#customizing-the-usage-help).

If your application has a lot of arguments, the usage syntax may become very long, and therefore
hard to read. Set the [`UsageWriter.UseAbbreviatedSyntax`][] property to omit all but the
positional arguments; the user can instead use the argument description list to see what arguments
are available.

If you are using [long/short mode](Arguments.md), you can set the [`UsageWriter.UseShortNamesForSyntax`][]
property to use short arguments names instead of long names, for arguments that have a short name,
in the usage syntax.

### Value descriptions

Arguments are followed by a short description of the type of value they support, in angle brackets.
This is called the _value description_. It's a short, typically one-word description that describes
the kind of value the argument expects. It should _not_ be used for the longer description of the
argument's purpose.

The value description defaults to the type of the argument (e.g. [`Int32`][] or [`String`][]), stripping off
any namespace prefixes. For multi-value arguments the element type is used, and for arguments using
[`Nullable<T>`][], the name of the type `T` is used. For dictionary arguments, the default is
`TKey=TValue`.

To specify a different value description for an argument, use the
[`CommandLineArgumentAttribute.ValueDescription`][] property, or the [`ValueDescriptionAttribute`][] for
arguments defined using a constructor parameter.

```csharp
[CommandLineArgument(ValueDescription = "Number")]
public int Argument { get; set; }
```

This will cause the argument's syntax to show `-Argument <Number>` instead of `-Argument <Int32>`.

You can also provide a custom default value description for a particular type by using the
[`ParseOptions.DefaultValueDescriptions`][] property:

```csharp
var options = new ParseOptions()
{
    DefaultValueDescriptions = new Dictionary<Type, string>()
    {
        { typeof(int), "Number" }
    },
}
```

Now, all arguments of type [`Int32`][] will use "Number" as the value description.

Switch arguments don't have a value description in the argument syntax, though they do in the
argument description list by default.

## Argument descriptions

After the usage syntax, the usage help ends with a list of all arguments with their detailed
descriptions.

The description of an argument can be specified using the
[`System.ComponentModel.DescriptionAttribute`][] attribute. Apply this attribute to the constructor
parameter or property defining the argument. It's strongly recommended to add a description to
every argument.

```csharp
[CommandLineArgument]
[Description("Provides a value to the application")]
public int Argument { get; set; }
```

By default, the list of argument descriptions will include any argument aliases, their default
values if set, and any [validator messages](Validation.md). This can be customized using the
[`UsageWriter`][] class.

You can choose which arguments are included in the description list using the
[`UsageWriter.ArgumentDescriptionListFilter`][] property. By default, this is set to
[`DescriptionListFilterMode.Information`][], which means that any argument that has any information
that isn't part of the usage syntax will be included. This could be a description, aliases, a
default value, or at least one validator message. You can choose to include only arguments with
descriptions (this was the default behavior before version 3.0), all arguments, or to omit the
description list entirely.

You can also choose the sort order of the description list using the
[`UsageWriter.ArgumentDescriptionListOrder`][]' property. This defaults to the same order as the
usage syntax, but you can also choose to sort by ascending or descending long or short name.

Since the static [`CommandLineParser.Parse<T>()`][] method will show usage help on error, if you have
a lot of arguments it may be necessary for the user to scroll up past the argument description list
to see the error message to determine what was wrong with the command line. Since this may be
inconvenient, you can choose to omit the argument description list, or the usage help entirely,
when an error occurs, using the [`ParseOptions.ShowUsageOnError`][] property. In this case, the user
will have to use the "-Help" argument to see the full help.

## Hidden arguments

Sometimes, you may want an argument to be available, but not easily discoverable. For example, if
an argument is deprecated, or part of preview functionality. For this purpose, you can hide an
argument, which means that it can still be used, but won't be included in the usage syntax or
argument description list.

So hide an argument, use the [`CommandLineArgumentAttribute.IsHidden`][] property.

```csharp
[CommandLineArgument(IsHidden = true)]
public int Argument { get; set; }
```

## Color output

When possible, Ookii.CommandLine will use color when writing usage help. This is controlled by the
[`UsageWriter.UseColor`][] property. When set to null (the default), the [`UsageWriter`][] tries to
determine whether color is supported. Color will only be enabled if:

1. There is no environment variable named `NO_COLOR`.
2. The standard output stream is not redirected.
3. The `TERM` environment variable is not set to `dumb`.
4. On Windows, enabling virtual terminal sequences using [`SetConsoleMode`][] must succeed.
5. On other platforms, the `TERM` environment variable must be defined.

[`UsageWriter`][] uses virtual terminal sequences to set color. Several components of the help have
preset colors, which can be customized using properties of the [`UsageWriter`][] class. Set them to any
of the constants of the [`TextFormat`][] class, or the return value of the [`GetExtendedColor()`][] method
for any 24-bit color, or any other valid virtual terminal sequence.

In order to support proper white-space wrapping text that contains virtual terminal sequences, the
[`LineWrappingTextWriter`][] class will not count virtual terminal sequences as part of the line length.

## Customizing the usage help

The usage help can be heavily customized. We've already seen how it can be customized using things
such as custom value descriptions, or various options of the [`UsageWriter`][] class. In addition to
properties already mentioned, the latter also allows you control things such as the amount of
indentation to use for the syntax and the description list, and the colors to use.

To provide further customization options, you can derive a class from the [`UsageWriter`][] class. The
[`UsageWriter`][] class has protected virtual methods for every part of the usage. These range from
top-level methods like [`WriteParserUsageCore()`][] which drives the entire process, methods responsible
for a section such as [`WriteParserUsageSyntax()`][] or [`WriteArgumentDescriptions()`][], methods
responsible for a single argument like [`WriteArgumentSyntax()`][] or [`WriteArgumentDescription()`][WriteArgumentDescription()_1], down
to methods that write single piece of text like [`WriteArgumentName()`][] or [`WriteValueDescription()`][].

> The [`UsageWriter`][] class has several properties and methods that apply only to
> [subcommands](Subcommands.md#subcommand-usage-help), so these will have no effect if you are not
> using subcommands.

These methods call each other, so you can customize as little or as much as you like, depending on
which methods you override. For example, if you want to use something other than angle brackets for
value descriptions, just override [`WriteValueDescription()`][] (and probably also
[`WriteValueDescriptionForDescription()`][]). Or, if you want to change the entire format of the
descriptions, override [`WriteArgumentDescription()`][WriteArgumentDescription()_1].

To specify a custom usage writer, assign it to the [`ParseOptions.UsageWriter`][] property.

The [custom usage sample](../src/Samples/CustomUsage) uses a custom usage writer, as well as a
custom [`LocalizedStringProvider`][] to radically alter the format of the usage help, as seen below.

```text
DESCRIPTION:
  Sample command line application with highly customized usage help. The application parses the
  command line and prints the results, but otherwise does nothing and none of the arguments are
  actually used for anything.

USAGE:
  CustomUsage [--source] <string> [--destination] <string> [arguments]

OPTIONS:
  -c|--count <number>         Provides the count for something to the application. [range: 0-100]
  -d|--destination <string>   The destination data.
  -D|--date <date-time>       Provides a date to the application.
  --day <day-of-week>         This is an argument using an enumeration type. Possible values:
                              Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
  -h|--help                   Displays this help message.
  --operation-index <number>  The operation's index. [default: 1]
  -p|--process                Does the processing.
  -s|--source <string>        The source data.
  -v|--verbose                Print verbose information; this is an example of a switch argument.
  --value <string>            This is an example of a multi-value argument, which can be repeated
                              multiple times to set more than one value.
  --version                   Displays version information.
```

The [WPF usage sample](../src/Samples/Wpf) is another example that uses a custom [`UsageWriter`][], in
this case to output the usage help as HTML.

You can see that the [`UsageWriter`][] class offers a lot of flexibility to customize the usage help
to your liking.

## Subcommand usage help

Please see the [subcommands documentation](Subcommands.md) for information about their usage help.

Next, we'll take a look at [argument validation and dependencies](Validation.md).
